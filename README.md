Shmup foundation project
====

A simple shmup foundation thingy. Made purely for learning purposes (for now).

####TODO:

- Make the enemies' movements more flexible, like the Complex Bullets
- Add enemy lifetime
- Rething the "being hit" and damage system?
- Separate players
- Effects
- GUI
- ...
- Actual enemies
- Actual bosses
- Actual gameplay


####DISCLAIMER
I do not own the spritesheets I used; they belong to Team Shanghai Alice
